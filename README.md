# nalpine
Latest Alpine + (docker dind, bash, curl, git, ca-certificates, gettext, bind-tools, make, jq)

This is a fork of [Valpine](https://github.com/digivava/valpine) but it is not Valpine so the name is nalpine :/ and auto update to latest version.

I created this to make gitlab CI/CD pipelines easier...
